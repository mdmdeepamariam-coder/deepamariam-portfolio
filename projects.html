        <p style="font-size: small;"> HomeBridge is a bilingual learning application designed to support newly immigrated children (ages 5–8) and their caregivers as they navigate everyday routines and emotional transitions. The project integrates language development, social–emotional learning, and family engagement through familiar, real-world contexts.</p>

          <h2>Caregiver Education and Student AI Reliance</h2>
          <h3>(Cognitive vs. Emotional Use Patterns in Adolescents)</h3>
          <span class="category">Harvard Graduate School of Education — AI & the Developing Child</span>

        <p style="font-size: small;">This research project examined how caregiver education levels influence adolescents’ cognitive and emotional reliance on AI tools. Using large-scale survey data, the study explored how trust in AI for learning tasks can extend into emotional reliance, raising important questions about equity, development, and technology use.</p>

          <h2>Effect of Fluorination on Bandgap and Nonlinear Optical Properties of Lithium-Substituted Adamantane</h2>
          <h3>(Publication - Chemical Physics Letters (Elsevier), 2019)</h3>
          <span class="category">Department of Physics, Anna University, Chennai</span>

        <img class="image fit" src="./images/MSC.png" alt="" />
        <p style="font-size: small;">This project was my postgraduate research work, where I investigated how fluorination influences the electronic bandgap and first- and second-order nonlinear optical properties of lithium-substituted adamantane molecules. The study used time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) to understand how molecular modifications affect optical responses relevant to photonic and optoelectronic applications. The research demonstrated that controlled fluorination can tune absorption wavelengths from the UV to IR range and significantly influence hyperpolarizability, with specific derivatives showing enhanced second harmonic generation efficiency at Nd:YAG laser wavelengths.</p>

          <h2>Educational Practicum (Learning Design & AI in Education)</h2>
          <span class="category">Harvard Graduate School of Education — Educational Product Practicuum EDU A096</span>
        </header>
        <img class="image fit" src="./images/Educational.png" alt="" />
        <p style="font-size: small;">This practicum gave me hands-on experience designing learning where AI is used as a cognitive partner, not a shortcut. I worked on structuring learning experiences that deliberately protect learners’ sense-making, judgment, and ownership, grounded in principles of self-regulated learning while using generative AI. I designed and tested task flows that guide learners through discovery, development, and final judgment, with a strong focus on how learners monitor what they know, recognize confusion, seek help strategically, and reflect ethically on their AI use. The work required sitting with ambiguity, revising ideas based on evidence, and making reasoned decisions—rather than accepting AI output at face value.
Through this practicum, I gained practical experience in: 
			Designing cognitively demanding tasks that encourage productive uncertainty before support
			Structuring prompts and checkpoints that support self-regulation and prevent over-reliance on AI
            Supporting metacognition, ethical reasoning, and transfer of learning in AI-mediated contexts
            Translating learning science principles into concrete, classroom-ready designs
This experience reshaped how I think about learning design in AI-rich environments—shifting my focus from how to use AI to how humans can learn efficiently, responsibly, and autonomously when learning with a cognitive partner.</p>
