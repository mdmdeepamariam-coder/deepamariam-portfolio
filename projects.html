          <h2>Educational Practicum (Learning Design & AI in Education)</h2>
          <span class="category">Harvard Graduate School of Education — Educational Product Practicuum EDU A096</span>

        <img class="image fit" src="./images/Educational 1.jpeg" alt="" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 70%; height: 90% auto; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px"/>
		<p style="font-size: small;">The practicum focused on designing learning with AI as a cognitive partner. Applied principles of self-regulated learning to protect learner sense-making and ownership. Designed task flows across discovery, development, and final judgment phases. Focused on how learners monitor understanding and identify moments of confusion. Structured prompts that support strategic help-seeking rather than AI dependence. Integrated ethical reflection around responsible and transparent AI use. Designed cognitively demanding tasks that encourage productive uncertainty. Revised learning designs based on evidence, critique, and reflection. Translated learning science concepts into practical, classroom-ready designs. Developed a human-centered approach to learning design in AI-rich environments.</p>

          <h2>HomeBridge - Bilingual Social Emotional Learning Application for Newly Immigrated Families</h2>

        <p style="font-size: small;"> HomeBridge is a bilingual learning app designed for young immigrant children and their families. It helps children learn basic English while also understanding and managing their emotions. The app uses familiar places like grocery stores to make learning feel safe and real. Children learn through play, visuals, and audio in two languages. Emotional check-ins help children name feelings like fear, excitement, or confusion. Parents receive simple guidance to support learning at home. The design connects school learning with everyday family life. The project was created as part of a Harvard Graduate School of Education course. It combines child development, inclusive design, and social–emotional learning. HomeBridge focuses on helping children feel confident, supported, and ready to learn.</p>

          <h2>Caregiver Education and Student AI Reliance</h2>
          <h3>(Cognitive vs. Emotional Use Patterns in Adolescents)</h3>

        <p style="font-size: small;">This project studied how high school students use AI and what shapes their reliance on it. Analysed survey data from over 7,700 students in a public school in Mexico. The focus was on two types of AI use: cognitive (learning and problem-solving) and emotional (advice and support). Examined whether caregiver education influences these patterns. Students with higher-educated caregivers used AI more for academic purposes. Emotional AI use did not vary much by caregiver education. However, students who relied on AI for thinking were more likely to rely on it emotionally as well. This shows that trust in AI often develops through learning tasks first. Over time, that trust can extend into emotional dependence. The findings highlight the need for AI literacy that supports both learning and emotional well-being.</p>

          <h2>Effect of Fluorination on Bandgap and Nonlinear Optical Properties of Lithium-Substituted Adamantane</h2>

        <p style="font-size: small;">This project studied how tiny changes in a molecule can change the way it interacts with light. I focused on a diamond-like molecule and examined how adding fluorine atoms and lithium alters its behaviour. Using computer simulations, I observed how these changes affect the colours of light the molecule can absorb. The molecule’s absorption could be shifted from ultraviolet light to visible and even infrared light. This means its light-handling properties can be carefully controlled. Some versions of the molecule were found to convert one colour of laser light into another strongly. This effect is used in real devices that change laser colours. Such colour-conversion is important in medical lasers, optical communication, and imaging systems. The study shows how materials can be “designed” at the atomic level for specific light-based technologies. Overall, the work connects fundamental physics with real-world laser and photonic applications.</p>
