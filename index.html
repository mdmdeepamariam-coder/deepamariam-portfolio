          <p>I am a learning and curriculum designer with a background in classroom teaching and instructional development across early and K–12 education. My work is grounded in learning science and focused on designing clear, structured learning experiences that support understanding, progression, and learner agency.
          <p>I have experience translating complex concepts into accessible instructional materials, developing curriculum frameworks, and creating documentation that enables consistent implementation across contexts. Having worked closely with diverse and multilingual learners, I approach learning design with attention to clarity, accessibility, and instructional coherence.
          </p>
          <p>My work at Harvard Graduate School of Education increasingly focuses on how learning environments—including digital tools and AI—shape thinking and decision-making. I design learning experiences where tools are used intentionally to support reasoning and skill development, while ensuring that learners retain ownership of their understanding. I approach learning design as a systems practice, aligning learning goals, scaffolds, assessments, and materials so that learning remains effective as it moves from design to delivery.
