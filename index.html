          <header><h2>About Me</h2></header>
          <p>I am an educator, learner, and emerging learning designer who began my professional journey in classrooms in India, working with children across early childhood, primary, and middle school. Teaching shaped how I see the world - not as a place to deliver information, but as a space to build understanding, confidence, and emotional safety for learners.
          </p>
          <p>Working closely with children aged 4–14 and their families taught me that learning is deeply human. It is shaped by relationships, clarity, culture, and care. These experiences grounded me in lesson design, communication, family engagement, and the everyday realities of learning spaces.
          </p>
          <p>Today, I am a graduate student in Human Development and Education at Harvard Graduate School of Education, where I am expanding my practice beyond classrooms into learning design, educational technology, and research. I am learning how to design learning experiences and tools that are evidence-based, developmentally appropriate, and responsive to real learner needs especially in a world increasingly shaped by technology and AI.
          </p>
          <p>I see myself as someone who bridges practice and theory: bringing the voice of the classroom into design and research, and carrying research back into meaningful, accessible learning experiences. I am driven by curiosity, reflection, and a commitment to creating learning that is inclusive, thoughtful, and human-centred.
